## Getting Started

### Desktop app from source

Install Node.js 22 or newer and npm, then run these commands in a clone of this repository:

```sh
npm ci
npm start
```

`npm test` launches the real Electron app with an isolated temporary profile and a mocked avatar catalog. It checks renderer isolation, saved data across restarts, external links, account label exports, and sandboxed module previews. It does not test authenticated VRChat sessions or live catalog availability.

### Windows builds

```sh
npm run pack
npm run dist:win
```

`pack` creates an unpacked app for the current platform. `dist:win` produces a Windows x64 installer (`CurryClient-Setup-1.0.0.exe`) and portable app (`CurryClient-Portable-1.0.0.exe`) in `dist/`. Build Windows packages on Windows. The Desktop GitHub Actions workflow tests and builds them, then uploads a `CurryClient-Windows` artifact on each PR and push.

To test an unpacked Windows build in PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:CURRYCLIENT_EXECUTABLE = "$PWD\dist\win-unpacked\CurryClient.exe"
npm test
Remove-Item Env:CURRYCLIENT_EXECUTABLE
```

Builds are unsigned and have no automatic updater. Windows may display an unrecognized-publisher warning.

### Linux builds

Build the x86-64 Linux archive and AppImage on Linux with `npm ci` followed by `npm run dist:linux`. The Desktop workflow runs the source, extracted-archive, and AppImage tests on Ubuntu 22.04 under Xvfb, then uploads both packages as `CurryClient-Linux`.

To run the AppImage from Releases:

```sh
chmod +x CurryClient-1.0.0-linux-x86_64.AppImage
./CurryClient-1.0.0-linux-x86_64.AppImage
```

The AppImage uses FUSE 2 (`libfuse2` on Ubuntu 22.04). On hosts without FUSE, run it with `--appimage-extract`, then launch `squashfs-root/AppRun`. Its launcher preserves Chromium sandboxing and does not automatically disable it when the host blocks user namespaces.

Download the Linux archive from Releases, keep the extracted folder together, and launch it as your normal desktop user:

```sh
tar -xzf CurryClient-1.0.0-linux-x64.tar.gz
cd CurryClient-1.0.0-linux-x64
./curryclient
```

The archive requires a graphical Linux session and Electron's system libraries. A working Chromium sandbox is required; distributions that restrict unprivileged user namespaces may require a sandbox policy or a root-owned `chrome-sandbox` helper with mode 4755. Do not disable sandboxing to launch the app. The archive does not install system packages or desktop shortcuts.

### Browser mode

Open `VRCclient.html` in a modern browser. No installation or build step is required.

## Data Storage

Saved avatars, worlds, player links, and account labels use local storage. The desktop app stores these in its own Electron user-data directory (`%APPDATA%\CurryClient` on Windows), separately from your browser. Browser data is not migrated automatically.

Account labels support JSON import and export; avatar, world, and player bookmarks are not migrated by a label export. Imported HTML modules last only for the current session. Removing the app's user-data directory or clearing browser storage removes the corresponding saved data.

## Desktop Security

The app serves only its bundled page through a private `curryclient://app/` origin, with a restrictive Content Security Policy. The renderer is sandboxed, context-isolated, and has no Node.js access, preload script, or IPC bridge. Camera, microphone, notifications, and other permission requests are denied.

Approved HTTPS links to VRChat, AVTRDB, VRClist, VRCMods, and Google Drive open in your default system browser. Login and signup remain in that browser; the app does not read browser profiles, credentials, or VRChat sessions. Imported HTML previews retain their script-disabled sandbox.

## External Services

CurryClient uses external services for certain browsing features, including:

- **AVTRDB** — avatar discovery.
- **VRClist** — world discovery.

External services may change their APIs or availability, which can affect related features.

## Compatibility

The desktop builds target Windows x64 and Linux x86-64. Linux CI uses Ubuntu 22.04; other distributions, ARM builds, and macOS packaging have not been validated. Browser mode requires a modern browser with JavaScript enabled.
